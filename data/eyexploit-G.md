# Finding 1 : Use cached state variable instead

```solidity
function accruedPerformanceFee() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 highWaterMark_ = highWaterMark;
        uint256 shareValue = convertToAssets(1e18);
        uint256 performanceFee = fees.performance;

        return
            performanceFee > 0 && shareValue > highWaterMark
                ? performanceFee.mulDiv(
                    (shareValue - highWaterMark) * totalSupply(),
                    1e36,
                    Math.Rounding.Down
                )
                : 0;
    }
```
Above state variable `highWaterMark` is cached into `highWaterMark_ ` but not used anywhere in the function. Each read from storage is expensive and cost 100 gas, caching it to the local variable can save good amount of gas. 

Gas per sload = 100
Total gas on n sload = 100n
where n, is times of state variable used. 

Gas that could be saved by caching = 100(n-1)

*Recommendation* : Consider using the `highWaterMark_ `
