# [G-01] State variables can be made immutable to save gas:

Variables that are immutable don't occupy storage slots of the contract, rather they are stored of the bytecode directly. So they access is cheaper because there is no need for the SLOAD instruction.

# [G-02] Sometimes is better to do assigments of structs from storage to local storage rather than doing them from storage to memory

The Solidity Documentation has a [section](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.18/types.html#data-location-and-assignment-behaviour) for data location and assigment behavior.  It says that when assigments are:

(1) From storage to memory it creates an independent copy
(2) From storage to local storage it only assigns a reference.

State variables that are structs can occupy more than 1 storage slot. When they are invoked during a function execution sometimes is better to do:

`Struct storage temp = TempMapping[key]` instead of `Struct memory temp = TempMapping[key]`.

The first one will only assign a reference, and you will use as many SLOADs instructions as many storage slots from the struct you read. The latter will do an independent copy, so that means that will SLOADs all the storage slots of the struct, even if you only read one during the function execution.

[LoC 254](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L254) at the MultiRewardStaking.sol contract.



# [G-03] Setting state variables to their default value refund gas.

At the page 12 of the [EVM yellowpaper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) one of the last paragraph says the following: 

"Storage fees have a slightly nuanced behaviourâ€”to incentivise minimisation of the use of storage (which corresponds directly to a larger state database on all nodes), the execution fee for an operation that clears an entry in the storage is not only waived, a qualified refund is given; in fact, this refund is effectively paid up-front since the initial usage of a storage location costs substantially more than normal usage."

# [G-04] Don't repeat statements already executed on the same function.

The `fundReward` function at the [MultiRewardStaking.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol) contract updates the `lastUpdatedTimestamp` of a staking token at the LoC 346:

`rewardInfos[rewardToken].lastUpdatedTimestamp = block.timestamp.safeCastTo32();`

But at the LoC 339 calls the internal function [_accrueRewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/utils/MultiRewardStaking.sol#L339) that does the same.

# [G-5] The `_transfer(address, address, uint256)` internal function from the `MultiRewardStaking.sol` contract can be implemented in a more gas-efficient manner.

In order to apply the `_transfer` logic, it uses the internal functions `_burn` and `_mint` which are implemented the following way:

```
function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: burn from the zero address");

        _beforeTokenTransfer(account, address(0), amount);

        uint256 accountBalance = _balances[account];
        require(accountBalance >= amount, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance");
        unchecked {
            _balances[account] = accountBalance - amount;
            // Overflow not possible: amount <= accountBalance <= totalSupply.
            _totalSupply -= amount;
        }

        emit Transfer(account, address(0), amount);

        _afterTokenTransfer(account, address(0), amount);
    }

function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: mint to the zero address");

        _beforeTokenTransfer(address(0), account, amount);

        _totalSupply += amount;
        unchecked {
            // Overflow not possible: balance + amount is at most totalSupply + amount, which is checked above.
            _balances[account] += amount;
        }
        emit Transfer(address(0), account, amount);

        _afterTokenTransfer(address(0), account, amount);
    }
```
Logic that is repeated:

(1) The `_transfer` function validates at the beginning that both accounts are not the `address(0)`. Then again, both `_mint` and `_burn` checks the same. 
(2) The `_transfer` function validates that the `_from` account has the enough funds. The `_burn` makes the same validation.
(3) Both `_mint` and `_burn` modifies the `_totalSupply` state variable, this is necessary in the context of those functions. But in a transfer there is no need to modify the `_totalSupply` since it will be maintained.

I suggest to rewrite the function like this:

```
function _transfer(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
  ) internal override accrueRewards(from, to) {
    super._transfer(from, to, amount);
 }
```
