L1 :  The NoFee error in MultiRewardEscrow is not used anywhere and could be removed.

L2 :
Error in NatSpec inconsistent with the documentation : for addTemplate() in DeploymentController it is stated "Caller must be owner." But there is no onlyOwner modifier on this function. The documentation says that "Anyone can add a new Template but only the contract owner can endorse them if they are deemed correct and safe", so the NatSpec here is probably misleading and there is no error in the code.

L3 :
Contracts are not directly implementing their interface contracts
There are interface contracts in src/interfaces/ for all contracts in src/ but they are not used directly. This means some method might actually not be overriden since the code is not making use of compiler checks. Make sure implementation contracts inherit directly from interface contracts.
